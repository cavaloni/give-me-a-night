renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component.\n *\n * The Modal offers a few helpful features over using just a `<Portal/>` component and some styles:\n *\n * - Manages dialog stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.\n * - Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.\n * - It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content, and keeping it there until the modal is closed.\n * - It disables scrolling of the page content while open.\n * - Adds the appropriate ARIA roles are automatically.\n * - Easily pluggable animations via a `<Transition/>` component.\n *\n * Note that, in the same way the backdrop element prevents users from clicking or interacting\n * with the page content underneath the Modal, Screen readers also need to be signaled to not to\n * interact with page content while the Modal is open. To do this, we use a common technique of applying\n * the `aria-hidden='true'` attribute to the non-Modal elements in the Modal `container`.
