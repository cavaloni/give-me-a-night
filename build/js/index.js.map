dialogs, lightboxes, or whatever else.\n * The Modal component renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component.\n *\n * The Modal offers a few helpful features over using just a `<Portal/>` component and some styles:\n *\n * - Manages dialog stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.\n * - Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.\n * - It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content, and keeping it there until the modal is closed.\n * - It disables scrolling of the page content while open.\n * - Adds the appropriate ARIA roles are automatically.\n * - Easily pluggable animations via a `<Transition/>` component.\n *\n * Note that, in the same way the backdrop element prevents users from clicking or interacting\n * with the page content underneath the Modal, Screen readers also need to be signaled to not to\n * interact with page content while the Modal is open. To do this, we use a common technique of applying\n * the `aria-hidden='true'` attribute to the non-Modal elements in the Modal `container`. This means that for\n * a Modal to be truly modal, it should have a `container` that is _outside_ your app's\n * React hierarchy (such as the default: document.body).\n */\nvar Modal = _react2.default.createClass({\n  displayName: 'Modal',\n\n\n  propTypes: _extends({}, _Portal2.default.propTypes, {\n\n    /**\n     * Set the visibility of the Modal\n     */\n    show: _react2.default.PropTypes.bool,\n\n    /**\n     * A Node, Component instance, or function that returns either.
